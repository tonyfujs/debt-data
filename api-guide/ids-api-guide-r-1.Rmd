This is first part of a two-part series on accessing the International Debt Statistics (IDS) database through the World Bank Data API. In this part, we will query the World Bank Data API to retrieve indicator names and location codes. In the second part (LINK NEEDED) guide, we will use that information to explore the **regional trends of long-term external debt stocks** from the IDS database. The following code will show step-by-step how to:

1. Setup up your environment with the needed packages
2. Create Indicator API Queries
3. Create Location API Queries

## 1. Setup
To start, make sure you have the following packages installed on your machine. To install an R package type install.packages("httr") into R. You can also visit each of the linked sites below for reference.

- [wbstats](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wbstats/vignettes/Using_the_wbstats_package.html): search and download WB API data
- [tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html):  Data work


Then, open up your preferred mode of writing R. This could be in [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/). Now follow the rest of the steps below to query the World Bank Data API to find your indicator and location codes.

```{r}
library(wbstats)
library(tidyverse)
```

## 2. Indicator API Queries
To get a data series from the World Bank's API, you need to use an "indicator code." For example, the indicator code for long-term external debt stock is DT.DOD.DLXF.CD. These indicator codes can be found in the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/), but you can also use the API to explore and select indicators. In this section, we will guide you through going from a topic idea to using the World Bank API to select an indictor code.

More information on this can also be found through the [Data Help Desk](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/898599-indicator-api-queries).

First, we should choose a topic. Topics are high level categories to which all indicators are mapped, such as Education, Trade, etc. The topic in this guide is "External Debt," but we will need the topic's ID in order to see all its indicator names and codes.

#### Getting the Topic ID for Debt

The following GET request will get us ALL the topics from the World Bank Data API. However, the request is returned in a json format that is difficult to read as is, so we will include some code to parse through it. Then we can see all the topic names and ids.

```{r}
# Get all the topic names from the World Bank API
topics <- wbtopics() %>%
  select(topicID, topic)
topics
```
We can now see that "External Debt" topic has the ID "20"

#### Getting the Indicator code

Now that we have the ID for the topic "External Debt," we can make another request to the World Bank API to receive all of the indicator names and codes associated with that topic. In the code below, notice that the ID for "External Debt" is placed in the URL between "topic" and "indicator."

There will likely be more External Debt indicators available than can fit on one page, the default amount is 30 results. So we will set the "per_page" parameter to 250. This will allow us to view all the results with one query, instead of having to request multiple pages. Then we can parse through the result to explore the different indicator Names and corresponding IDs. Because there so many indicators, the results are also saved as "ids-indicators.csv." (LINK NEEDED)

```{r}
# make request to World Bank API
indicators <- wbstats:::wbget("http://api.worldbank.org/v2/topic/20/indicator?format=JSON") 

indicators %>%
  select(id, name) %>%
  head(20) # returns only the first 20 rows

```


The resulting list gives us all of the External Debt indicators and their codes. We are interested in "DT.DOD.DLXF.CD External debt stocks, long-term (DOD, current US$)." When using data, it's important to understand the full definition. You can use an API query to get that information as well!

```{r}
# use the indicator code to define x
x <- "DT.DOD.DLXF.CD"

# use the above indicator code to find associate "sourceNote" or definition
indicators %>%
  filter(id == x) %>%
  pull(sourceNote)
```

By using the API queries above, we were able sort through the World Bank API topics, find External Debt, explore the available indicators, select one and find its corresponding indicator id, and then finally get the defintion of the indicator.

## 2. Location API Queries

Now that we have the indicator code, we need to select the location. To select a location by country, region, or income level you will need to know its 2 or 3 letter code. This section will show you how to use similar API queries to pull the location names and codes. 

For more information on this visit the [Data Help Desk](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/898590-country-api-queries).

When pulling the list of locations, I will set the per_page result to 300, as there will be more than 50 results (which is the default).

```{r}
# Make request to World Bank API
locations <- wbcountries()
```

In particular, we want the "id" and the corresponding "name." Because there are so many locations, the results are also saved as "location-codes.csv"(LINK NEEDED)
```{r}
# Print the data frame and review the indicator names and ids
locations %>%
  select(iso3c, country) %>%
  head(20)
```

From the resulting list, you can select the location ids for the countries or regions of interest.
